        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our WiFi Jammer project! This project is part of our curriculum at Cochin Arts and Science
            College, designed to provide a deep understanding of wireless communication and its vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h2>About PAL3RMO DEAUTHER Version 3.0.0</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>PAL3RMO DEAUTHER</strong> is a powerful WiFi deauthentication tool designed for educational and
                testing purposes. The latest version, <strong>3.0.0</strong>, brings enhanced features and improved
                performance to help you understand and experiment with WiFi networks.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Deauthentication Attack: Disconnects devices from a WiFi network.</li>
            <li>Beacon Flooding: Generates fake access points to confuse devices.</li>
            <li>Packet Monitoring: Monitors packets in the WiFi spectrum.</li>
            <li>Enhanced User Interface: Easy-to-use interface for quick operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>The PAL3RMO DEAUTHER operates by sending deauthentication frames to a target device, effectively
            disconnecting it from the WiFi network. This tool is highly effective in demonstrating the vulnerabilities
            of WiFi networks and the importance of secure network configurations.</p>

        <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
